************************************Evaluation Report*******************************************
### testbench comprehensiveness checkpoints

#### edge detection: (1 pts)
- verified that `signal_out` is `1` only when there is a rising edge on `signal_in`: **score: 1**

#### multiple edges: (1 pts)
- no test case was found applying multiple rising edges on `signal_in` and confirming `signal_out` is asserted for one clock cycle for each rising edge: **score: 0**

#### no false positives: (1 pts)
- test confirms that `signal_out` returns to `0` after one cycle when there is no rising edge, but fails to ensure that `signal_out` remains `0` when `signal_in` is stable: **score: 0**

**final score: 1/3**
