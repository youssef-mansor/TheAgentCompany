\n        You are a judge evaluating a file content against predefined checkpoints.  \n        Each checkpoint has an assigned score.\n\n        Task:  \n        1. Analyze the file based on the given checkpoints.  \n        2. If a checkpoint is met, assign the corresponding score else assign zero. \n        3. Generate a detailed report with the following format:  \n            - Clearly list each checkpoint and the corresponding score assigned.  \n            - Conclude the report with the final score in the format:  \n                **Final Score: <score>/<total>**\n        Don't make introduction or conclusion just respond directly with the report in the format specified above.\n\n    \n\n        # Checkpoints\n\n    ## Vending Machine FSM Checkpoints - Total 5 pts (grade_checkpoint2)  \n\n### 1. Module Interface (1 pt)  \n   Defines the required ports correctly:  \n   clk, reset;       // Clock and reset signals  \n   [x:x] money;      // Inserted money  \n   [x:x] select_product; // Product selection  \n   [x:x] extra_cash; // Additional inserted money  \n   prodA, prodB, prodC; // Product dispense signals  \n   [x:x] balance;    // Remaining balance  \n   \n\n### 2. State Definition (1 pt)  \n   Defines parameters for the different states of the vending machine.  \n\n### 3. State Transitions (1 pt)  \n   Implements a procedural block to handle transitions between states.  \n\n### 4. Reset Behavior (1 pt)  \n   Ensures that on reset, the machine returns to a void/default/initial state.  \n\n### 5. State Transition Logic (1 pt)  \n   Uses a `case` statement to transition between states based on inserted money and product selection.  \n\n### 6. Output Handling (1 pt)  \n   Defines machine output logic in a procedural block based on the current state and uses `$display` for output visualization.\n\n        Listed below are the contents for all files in the workspace. You are required to evaluate only the file that is\n        relevant to the defined checkpoints.\n\n    \n# /workspace/vending_machine.v\n```verilog\nmodule vending_machine (\n    input wire clk,\n    input wire reset,\n    input wire [5:0] money,      // 5, 10, 20\n    input wire [1:0] select_product,\n    input wire extra_cash,       // Signal to add more money\n    output reg prodA,\n    output reg prodB,\n    output reg prodC,\n    output reg [5:0] balance    // Maximum balance needed is 40 (when inserting 20*2)\n);\n\n    // FSM states\n    localparam IDLE = 3'b000;\n    localparam MONEY_INSERTED = 3'b001;\n    localparam DISPENSE = 3'b010;\n    localparam RETURN_CHANGE = 3'b011;\n    localparam WAIT_MORE = 3'b100;\n\n    // Product prices\n    localparam PRICE_A = 5;\n    localparam PRICE_B = 10;\n    localparam PRICE_C = 15;\n\n    // State and balance registers\n    reg [2:0] state, next_state;\n    reg [5:0] current_balance, required_amount;\n    \n    // State register\n    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin\n        if (reset) begin\n            state <= IDLE;\n            current_balance <= 0;\n            prodA <= 0;\n            prodB <= 0;\n            prodC <= 0;\n            balance <= 0;\n        end else begin\n            state <= next_state;\n            \n            // Reset product outputs every cycle unless explicitly set\n            prodA <= 0;\n            prodB <= 0;\n            prodC <= 0;\n            balance <= 0;\n            \n            case (state)\n                default: begin\n                    // Do nothing\n                end\n                \n                IDLE: begin\n                    if (money > 0 && (money == 5 || money == 10 || money == 20)) begin\n                        current_balance <= money;\n                    end\n                end\n                \n                MONEY_INSERTED: begin\n                    if (money > 0 && (money == 5 || money == 10 || money == 20)) begin\n                        if (!extra_cash) begin\n                            current_balance <= money;\n                        end else begin\n                            current_balance <= current_balance + money;\n                        end\n                    end\n                end\n                \n                DISPENSE: begin\n                    case (select_product)\n                        2'b00: begin\n                            prodA <= 1;\n                            balance <= current_balance - PRICE_A;\n                            current_balance <= 0;\n                        end\n                        2'b01: begin\n                            prodB <= 1;\n                            balance <= current_balance - PRICE_B;\n                            current_balance <= 0;\n                        end\n                        2'b10: begin\n                            prodC <= 1;\n                            balance <= current_balance - PRICE_C;\n                            current_balance <= 0;\n                        end\n                        default: begin\n                            balance <= current_balance;\n                            current_balance <= 0;\n                        end\n                    endcase\n                end\n                \n                RETURN_CHANGE: begin\n                    balance <= current_balance;\n                    current_balance <= 0;\n                end\n                \n                WAIT_MORE: begin\n                    if (money > 0 && extra_cash && (money == 5 || money == 10 || money == 20)) begin\n                        current_balance <= current_balance + money;\n                    end\n                end\n            endcase\n        end\n    end\n\n    // Next state logic\n    always @(*) begin\n        next_state = IDLE;
