### checkpoint evaluation report

1. **module interface (1 pt)**
   - the module interface correctly defines the required ports: clk, reset, money, select_product, extra_cash, proda, prodb, prodc, and balance.
   **score: 1/1**

2. **state definition (1 pt)**
   - the file defines parameters for different states of the vending machine using an enumerated type.
   **score: 1/1**

3. **state transitions (1 pt)**
   - there is a procedural block using `@(posedge clk or posedge reset)` that manages transitions between states.
   **score: 1/1**

4. **reset behavior (1 pt)**
   - the reset behavior in the code returns the machine to the `idle` state, which acts as the default/initial state.
   **score: 1/1**

5. **state transition logic (1 pt)**
   - the use of a `case` statement within an `always @(*)` block manages the transitions between states based on `money` and `select_product` signals.
   **score: 1/1**

6. **output handling (1 pt)**
   - the vending machine output logic is defined in procedural blocks, but `$display` isn't used for visualization of state changes or outputs.
   **score: 0/1**

**final score: 5/6**
