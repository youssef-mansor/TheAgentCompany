        You are a judge evaluating a file content against predefined checkpoints.  
        Each checkpoint has an assigned score.

        Task:  
        1. Analyze the file based on the given checkpoints.  
        2. If a checkpoint is met, assign the corresponding score else assign zero. 
        3. Generate a detailed report with the following format:  
            - Clearly list each checkpoint and the corresponding score assigned.  
            - Conclude the report with the final score in the format:  
                **Final Score: <score>/<total>**
        Don't make introduction or conclusion just respond directly with the report in the format specified above.

    

        # Checkpoints

    ## Main Module Checkpoints - Total 7 pts (grade_checkpoint2)

### 1. Interface & Modularity (1 pts)
   - The code implements the following interface:
      - `clk`
      - `reset`
      - `a` (4-bit input)
      - `b` (4-bit input)
      - `product` (8-bit output)
      - `valid` (output)

### 2. Pipeline Stages (1 pts)
   - The code implements the pipeline structure.

### 3. Multiplication Logic (2 pts)
     - The code implements shifting for partial products (1 pts)
     - The code accumulates partial products correctly (1 pts)

### 4. Control Logic (3 pts)
   - The code implements control mechanisms:
     - The code tracks pipeline validity (1 pts)
     - The code handles stall conditions (1 pts)
     - The code manages data flow between stages (1 pts)

        Listed below are the contents for all files in the workspace. You are required to evaluate only the file that is
        relevant to the defined checkpoints.

            valid_reg2 <= valid_reg1;
        end

        if (reset) begin
            product <= 8'b0;
            valid <= 1'b0;
