        You are a judge evaluating a file content against predefined checkpoints.  
        Each checkpoint has an assigned score.

        Task:  
        1. Analyze the file based on the given checkpoints.  
        2. If a checkpoint is met, assign the corresponding score else assign zero. 
        3. Generate a detailed report with the following format:  
            - Clearly list each checkpoint and the corresponding score assigned.  
            - Conclude the report with the final score in the format:  
                **Final Score: <score>/<total>**
        Don't make introduction or conclusion just respond directly with the report in the format specified above.

    

        # Checkpoints

    ## Testbench Comprehensiveness checkpoints - Total 3 pts (grade_checkpoint3)

Ensure the following points are addressed within the test bench 

### Edge Detection: (1 pts)
   - Verify that `signal_out` is `1` only when there is a rising edge on `signal_in`.

### Multiple Edges: (1 pts)
   - Apply multiple rising edges on `signal_in` and confirm that `signal_out` is asserted for one clock cycle for each rising edge.

### No False Positives: (1 pts)
   - Ensure that `signal_out` remains `0` when `signal_in` remains stable (high or low) between clock cycles.

        Listed below are the contents for all files in the workspace. You are required to evaluate only the file that is
        relevant to the defined checkpoints.
