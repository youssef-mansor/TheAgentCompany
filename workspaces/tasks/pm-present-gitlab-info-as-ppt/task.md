Our CTO, Sarah Johnson, want to know more on the engineering progress we've been made throughtout the past few months, so she requested a presentation introducing all gitlab repositories we have now. You can access this at http://the-agent-company.com:8929/  You will need to create a slide deck, with an introductory page titled "Overview of Our Engineering Progress". Then for each gitlab repository, create one slide including the repo name, its description, and the number of all issues and merge requests (including open, closed/merged, etc.)
Save the presentation to '/workspace/Engineering_Progress.pptx'. Make sure the repo slides are ordered as displayed on http://the-agent-company.com:8929/
