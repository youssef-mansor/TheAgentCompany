The password for unzipping the file is `2039fome`. I don't have the details about the event-viewer's codebase, but it's a flask app and the README should be enough to get you started. If you need any info about the database, I don't have it but Zhang should know.",

    "extra_info": "I think the database is located in `app/event-viewer/database`. It's implemented as encrypted Parquet files. Parquet is a columnar storage format that's efficient for big data. But Parquet files are not human-readable. If you want to read parquet files, you can use a library like `pyarrow`. The database password is `cat123`.",
