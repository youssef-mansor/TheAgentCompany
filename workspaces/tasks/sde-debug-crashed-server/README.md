# Check for Event Viewer Server Crash

A task about debugging a problem with a crashing server and fixing it.

## Setup

The code for the server is included in `events-viewer.zip`, which consists of the following files:

```bash
events-viewer/app.py
events-viewer/requirements.txt
events-viewer/README.md
```

To create the `events-viewer.zip` file with the password `2039fome`, run the following command in the `events-viewer` directory:

```bash
zip -r events-viewer.zip events-viewer/app.py events-viewer/README.md events-viewer/requirements.txt -P 2039fome
```

The database file `events.db` is generated by the `populate_database.py` script. If you need to regenerate it, run the following command:

```bash
cd events-viewer && python populate_database.py
```
