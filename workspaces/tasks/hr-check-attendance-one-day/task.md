* Use the provided attendance-2024-03-01.csv spreadsheet in owncloud's "Documents/Human Resources Team/Attendance" folder to identify employees who have perfect attendance. Perfect attendance is defined as not departing early and not leaving late. Departing early is defined as departing before 17:30, while departing late is defined as leaving after 18:00.

* Create a report called "2024-03-attendance-summary.xlsx" in the local /workspace directory. You must make sure that it is a xlsx file.

* In the report, have one column with the name "Name". Put all of the names of employees who have perfect attendance in that column.
