Find the receipt for reimbursement in /Documents/Financials/receipt.jpg on NextCloud(https://ogma.lti.cs.cmu.edu/apps/files/files).
Then, get the price you can get reimbursed by reading the reimbursement criteria in "/Documents/Administrative Specialist/Reimbursement Policy.pdf"

Talk to Mike Chen on RocketChat (http://the-agent-company.com:3000/) and inform him of the price you can reimburse for the receipt.
