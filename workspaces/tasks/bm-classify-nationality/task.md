Please check the "Documents/Data Analysis/Customer.xlsx" spreadsheet available at https://ogma.lti.cs.cmu.edu/apps/files/files. 
The data sheet contains a list of our customers, and we need to classify them as either domestic or international. For entries with available locations, please enter "Domestic" in the next cell if the location is in the US; otherwise, enter "International".

Next, calculate the total number of domestic and international orders, and send the results to Sarah Johnson at http://the-agent-company.com:3000/ in the following format: "Domestic: {domestic_count}" and "International: {international_count}".
