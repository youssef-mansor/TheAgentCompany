For each repository on our company GitLab, which can be found here http://the-agent-company.com:8929/ , calculate the number of commits to each repository by each member and collate it into a csv file `commit_report.csv` under `/workspace/`. The format should be:

week,user,repo1,repo2,repo3,...
YYYY/DD/MM,username,integer,integer,integer,...

The week should start on sunday and end on saturday.
