On our office cloud at http://the-agent-company.com:8092/, analyze the stock trend in /Documents/Financials/stock_data_raw.csv, create an informative, business-style presentation of stock price data for the company board members.

* Data Preparation: Use the provided stock data, ensuring it is clean and suitable for analysis. Handle any missing or inconsistent values appropriately. Save the cleaned data as /Documents/Financials/stock_presentation/stock_cleaned.csv

* Create Visualizations:
    * Closing Prices Over Time: Display the stock's closing prices over time to show the overall trend.
    * Close Price with 50 and 200-Day Moving Averages: Overlay the 50-day and 200-day moving averages onto the closing price plot. This will provide insights into short-term vs. long-term trends.
    * Correlation Between Columns: Visualize the correlation matrix between variables, with a focus on the relationship between price, volume, and returns.
    * Daily Return Distribution: Calculate and plot the daily returns (percentage change between closing prices on consecutive days) to highlight the volatility and risk associated with the stock.
    * Volume Distribution: Plot the distribution of trade volumes to identify trends in stock interest over time.

* Presentation Preparation:
    * Create clean, professional slides with pptx. Each plot should be on a separate slide, clearly labeled, and accompanied by brief explanations. Save as /Documents/Financials/stock_presentation/stock_analysis.pptx.
    * Write a script for the presenter to guide the audience through the trends observed in each visualization. Each slide is described and analyzed. Save as /Documents/Financials/stock_presentation/stock_analysis_script.md.
