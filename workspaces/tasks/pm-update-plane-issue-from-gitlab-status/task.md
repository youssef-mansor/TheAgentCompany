In Plane there are two issues for JanusGraph in sprint 1, "Improve Logging for Bulk Request Failures" and "Optimize Retry Mechanism for Out of Memory Errors". For each of the issues, you need to check the status of the issue in GitLab by going to the issue's page. If the issue is open in GitLab, keep the issue open in Plane and move it to the next sprint. If the issue is closed in GitLab, close the issue in Plane.
