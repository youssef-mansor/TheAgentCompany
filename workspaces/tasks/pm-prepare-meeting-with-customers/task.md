We are about to meet with potential customers for our openhands agent services. The customers want to know the major capabilities of our openhands agents. Your task is to find the current benchmarks that openhands (http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/openhands) can solve, categorize them into task domains, and then create a presentation slide deck introducing each domain per page. Save the final presentation as '/workspace/openhands_intro.pptx' and send the file name to Huang Jie on http://the-agent-company.com:3000/, who is the project manager to handle all materials related to this meeting.
