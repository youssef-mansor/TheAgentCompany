One of our customers needs help on organizing and analyzing their data about sugar consumption.
Find the 'total-sugar-sources.xlsx' under "/Documents/Data Analysis" on owncloud(http://the-agent-company.com:8092), and 'Top Sources of Total Sugars.xlsx' in the same directory.

Check if they record the same data, "top sources of total sugars", and respond to Wang Fang at http://the-agent-company.com:3000/. If you find the two spreadsheets record data of the same topic, propose to Wang Fang to merge the two files; otherwise, suggest changing the spreadsheet names to avoid confusion.

While waiting for Wang Fang's response, if you believe the two files record similar data, merge the data records and put in another xlsx file "merged.xlsx", save it locally under "/workspace/". Don't upload the file to owncloud unless Wang Fang requests so.
