* Use the provided april-attendance-data.csv spreadsheet in Nextcloud's "Documents/Human Resources Team/Attendance" folder to calculate the following for each employee: average work length in hours, the number of days of on-time departure, and the number of days of late arrival for each employee. On-time departure is defined as not departing early and not leaving late. Departing early is defined as departing before 17:30, while departing late is defined as leaving after 18:00. Late arrival is defined as arriving later than 9:00.

* Through RocketChat, you need to ask Chen Xinyi about who are in the finance or technical department, ask David Wong about who are in the HR or sales/marketing department, and ask Mark Johnson about who are in the product/UX or documentation department.

* Create a report called "department-april-attendace.xlsx" in the local /workspace directory. You must make sure that it is a xlsx file.

* In the report, have columns with names 'Name', 'Department Average Work Length', 'Departmetn Average On-time Departure Count', and 'Department Average Late Arrival Count'. Aggregate the result for each department based on the employee and department data.
