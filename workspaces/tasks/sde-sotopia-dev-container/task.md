For the sotopia project in gitlab (http://the-agent-company.com:8929/), create a dev docker container in the new branch `feature/dev-container` that allows users to set things up for development easily. The dev docker will set up the Python, Redis, and Ollama support. It would automatically install poetry and sotopia, and serve Llama 3.2 1b on start.
Make a pull request to the repo after setting up the dockerfile.
