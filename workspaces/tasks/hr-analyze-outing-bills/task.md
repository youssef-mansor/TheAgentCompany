The company has gone on several team lunches and dinners. Help record and organise these. Locate all receipts under the directory Documents/Financials/outings on Owncloud (http://the-agent-company.com:8092) in any format (e.g., .jpg, .png, .pdf).

Next, create a structured Excel sheet with the following columns:

1. Receipt ID (auto-generate a unique identifier for each receipt).
2. Establishment
3. Address
4. Datetime (in m/d/yy h:mm format)
5. Items Ordered (all the items in a list)
6. Number of Items
7. Total Amount (use the after tax value, store as integers, no need for dollar sign just the value)

Save the file as Organized_Outings_Receipts.xlsx locally in /workspace directory.

Also, perform analysis to help understand the spendings.

Next create a line graph showing the change in spending during outings over time and save this as outings_graph.png in the /workspace folder.

Ping HR Chen Xinyi on Rocketchat at https://the-agent-company.com:3000/home with inks of the excel sheet and the word document, as well as a general trend of the total spending over time (increases, decreases, no difference, etc.)
