## Main Module Checkpoints - Total 4 pts (grade_checkpoint2)

### 1. Interface & Modularity (1 pts)
   - The code implements the following ports:
     - The code has two 4-bit input buses for operands (A[3:0], B[3:0])
     - The code has a 1-bit carry input (Cin)
     - The code has a 4-bit output sum bus (Sum[3:0])
     - The code has a 1-bit carry output (Cout)
     - The code uses proper port directions (input/output)

### 2. Generate & Propagate Logic (1 pts)
   - The code implements bit-level logic:
     - The code calculates generate signals (Gi = Ai AND Bi)
     - The code calculates propagate signals (Pi = Ai XOR Bi)
     - The code implements these for each bit position (i = 0 to 3)
     - The code maintains proper bit correspondence

### 3. Carry Lookahead Logic (1 pts)

### 4. Sum Generation (1 pts)
   - The code implements sum computation:
     - The code calculates Sum[0] = P0 XOR Cin
     - The code calculates Sum[1] = P1 XOR C1
     - The code calculates Sum[2] = P2 XOR C2
     - The code calculates Sum[3] = P3 XOR C3
