As our first data scientist intern, we designed a simple SQL exercise for you to help you get your hands dirty.

You are provided with a SQL database containing product data. Write three SQL queries to analyze the data and write the answer in 3 txt files, one for each task (file names should be task1.txt, task2.txt, task3.txt, respectively). The txt files should be placed under `/workspace` directory. The exercise database is located at /data/database.db. You can access it using the SQLite command line tool.

Task 1: Find the total number of products in the database
Task 2: Find how many different product categories exist
Task 3: Find the top 3 most expensive products in the Electronics category. Show only product name and price in each line (e.g. 
"A", 123.45,
"B", 12.34,
"C", 1.23
) with two digits
