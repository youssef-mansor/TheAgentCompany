Navigate to the Rocketchat website at http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home and ask the director of Finance for the folder path for the annual company updates. You can navigate to the path provided through Owncloud, using this link http://the-agent-company.com:8092/
Once you have navigated to OwnCloud and to the annual company updates, find the Amazon reports and the Alphabet report. Your job is to create a CSV table of all the signatures within these reports. 
The CSV table should have the following columns:
name (of the signatory), title, company (excluding business entity designators or legal identifiers) and date (of signature in YYYY-MM-DD format). Save this file as 'signatories.csv' in the '/workspace' folder.

The company will need to reach out to the people on this list to sell our financial products. Reach out to the director of sales providing this table. Include the path of where the csv is saved and tell the director of sales how many people we need to reach out to.
