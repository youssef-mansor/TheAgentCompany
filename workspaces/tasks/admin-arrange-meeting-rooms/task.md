Good morning! We're facing a scheduling challenge at office. All 6 teams have submitted their meeting requests for next Tuesday. The teams have scheduled their meetings as follows:


The Engineering team has a morning meeting from 9:00 AM to 10:30 AM, followed by a second meeting from 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM, and another session in the afternoon from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM. 
The Marketing team starts their quick meeting at 9:15 AM, ending at 10:00 AM, and has another meeting from 11:30 AM to 12:30 PM. Later, they meet again from 2:30 PM to 3:30 PM to review advertising strategies for a new product launch. 
The Sales team needs to meet from 9:45 AM to 11:00 AM, with another meeting from 11:30 AM to 12:15 PM. Their third meeting is from 2:00 PM to 3:30 PM to discuss client follow-ups. 
The HR team has scheduled their meeting from 10:45 AM until 11:30 AM, with a follow-up session from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM to discuss employee engagement. 
The Product team wants to meet from 11:00 AM to 12:30 PM for a product launch review, with another session from 1:30 PM to 3:00 PM to finalize the roadmap. 
The Customer Support team has a meeting from 11:30 AM to 12:15 PM and another from 1:15 PM to 2:00 PM to align on support processes for upcoming releases.


Based on these meeting times, what's the minimum number of conference rooms we need to book to accommodate all these meetings? Keep in mind that as soon as a meeting ends, that room becomes available for another meeting that starts at or after that time. Can you help figure this out? Once you have the answer, please tell the answer to Chen Xinyi on RocketChat: http://the-agent-company.com:3000/. Oh btw, please also write the answer down in /workspace/ans.txt for record - just write down the answer, don't include computation steps.
