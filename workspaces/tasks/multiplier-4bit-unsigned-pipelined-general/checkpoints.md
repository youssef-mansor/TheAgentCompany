## Main Module Checkpoints - Total 4 pts (grade_checkpoint2)

### 1. Interface & Modularity (1 pts)
   - The code implements the following ports:
     - The code has clock and reset inputs
     - The code has two 4-bit input buses (multiplicand[3:0], multiplier[3:0])
     - The code has an 8-bit output product bus (product[7:0])
     - The code has a valid_out signal indicating result ready
     - The code has a valid_in signal for input validation

### 2. Pipeline Stages (1 pts)
   - The code implements the pipeline structure:
     - The code has input registration stage
     - The code has partial product generation stage
     - The code has partial product accumulation stages
     - The code has final result stage
     - The code maintains pipeline control signals

### 3. Multiplication Logic (1 pts)
   - The code implements multiplication components:
     - The code generates partial products:
       - PP0 = multiplicand AND multiplier[0]
       - PP1 = (multiplicand AND multiplier[1]) << 1
       - PP2 = (multiplicand AND multiplier[2]) << 2
       - PP3 = (multiplicand AND multiplier[3]) << 3
     - The code implements proper shifting
     - The code accumulates partial products
     - The code handles timing between stages

### 4. Control Logic (1 pts)
   - The code implements control mechanisms:
     - The code tracks pipeline validity
     - The code handles stall conditions
     - The code manages data flow between stages
     - The code ensures proper output timing
