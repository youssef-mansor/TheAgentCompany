A new sprint just started in the RisingWave project and you have to assign Li Ming to a new issue in GitLab. Using RocketChat, ask Li Ming to provide you with the issue he wants to work on and the milestone to assign it to. Once you have the issue, create the issue in GitLab and assign it to the milestone.
