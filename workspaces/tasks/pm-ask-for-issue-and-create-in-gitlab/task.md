A new sprint just started in the RisingWave project and you have to assign Li Ming to a new issue in GitLab. Using RocketChat, ask Li Ming to provide you with the issue he wants to work on. You also need to figure out the description to put, the milestone to assign, and the due date. Once you have all the information, create the issue in GitLab.
