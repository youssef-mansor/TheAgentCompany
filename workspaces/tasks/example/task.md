Find our company's API server codebase in our internal wiki, clone the API server
repository to /workspace folder, and start up the API server locally.
Keep the API server running in background. You could use http://the-agent-company.com:3000/
to ask Alex Turner for the internal wiki. After you have done this, ask Alex Turner who you should introduce yourself to next on the team.
