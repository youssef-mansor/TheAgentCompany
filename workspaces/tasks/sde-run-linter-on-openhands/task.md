The OpenHands repo uses 'single quote' convention, rather than 'double quote' convention adopted by black linter. Let's change all single quotes to double quotes if possible! You need to run black formatter and change all single quotes to double quotes, if possible. Of course, don't break the existing code! Clone the openhands repo http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/openhands/ to /workspace folder and do your work locally.
