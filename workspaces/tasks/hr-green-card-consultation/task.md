Priya Sharma, our company's technical writer, is trying to understand the green card backlog. Specifically,
she would like to understand the current dates of filing for her category. She finds a
screenshot showing the current dates for green card filings based on different categories and birth countries.
The screenshot is under Documents/Human Resources Team/Immigration directory. Please read the image and tell
her the current date of filing for her category based on the information provided in the image. If you need any information, please ask her. You can find
her on RocketChat.
