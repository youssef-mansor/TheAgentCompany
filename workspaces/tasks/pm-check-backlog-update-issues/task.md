Your task is to monitor the "Node-RED" project for backlog issues and follow up on Rocket.Chat.
First, log into Plane at http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects. Look for the project called "Node-RED". 
Once you're in, scan through all the issues. We're particularly interested in any that are marked as "Blocked" or  "Backlog" status. For each of these, make a note of three things:
     - The Issue ID
     - The Issue Title
     - Who it's assigned to (the Assignee)

Now, head over to our team chat on Rocket.Chat at http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home . Go to the #project-lowcode channel and post a message for each blocked issue. It should look something like this:

     @Assignee (if it was assigned to anyone), [Blocking/backlog Issue Title] has the status Backlog/Blocked. Has it been completed yet?"

4. Keep an eye on the responses in the chat. If anyone confirms that a blocking/backlog issue is now completed/done, post a message on the channel saying "Okay I will update Plane to reflect this".

5. Go back to Plane and update the status of the previously blocked issue. Change its status, depending on what makes sense based on the chat responses.
