Your task is to monitor the "Frontend and Backend Enhancements" project for backlog issues and follow up on Rocket.Chat.

#### Steps:

1. First, log into our project management tool, Plane. Look for the project called "Sprint - Frontend and Backend Enhancements". 

2. Once you're in, scan through all the issues. We're particularly interested in any that are marked as "Blocked" or still in "Backlog" status. For each of these, make a note of three things:
     - The Issue ID
     - Who it's assigned to (the Assignee)
     - What issue is blocking it (the Blocking Issue and then check the Assignee of that issue)

3. Now, head over to our team chat on Rocket.Chat. Go to the #sprint-planning channel and post a message for each blocked issue. It should look something like this:

     @BlockingAssignee, quick question - has [Blocking Issue Title/ID] been completed yet? I noticed that the issue [Issue Title/ID] is blocked by [Blocking Issue Title/ID] "

4. Keep an eye on the responses in the chat. If anyone confirms that a blocking issue is now "Done", it's time to update Plane.

5. Go back to Plane and update the status of the previously blocked issue. Change it to either "In Progress" or "Completed", depending on what makes sense based on the chat responses.

6. Also, add comment in this updated issue, tagging the assignee of the issue that was blocked by this issue and say that the blocking issue is done.
