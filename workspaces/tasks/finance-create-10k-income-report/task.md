Navigate to the folder /Documents/Financials/Annual%20Reports/10Ks on Owncloud (http://the-agent-company.com:8092)
Here you wil find 10K annual reports for multiple tech companies. Extract the net income data for each company from their 10-K reports (in section/item 8) for the years 2021, 2022, and 2023, and compile it into a structured table. 
The table should be in a csv format and should have the following column strucutre:
- 'Company Name': The company name according to the name of registrant as specified in its charter document.
- 'Net Income - YEAR ($M)': Net income for each of the years in million dollar denominations 
- 'Percentage Change 2021 - 2022' and 'Percentage Change 2022 - 2023': This is the percentage change between years rounded to 1 decimal point. Save it as /workspace/net_income_report.csv
Once that is compiled send the path of this table to David Wong, the head of finance on Rocketchat - http://the-agent-company.com:3000/. With this, suggest to him which company we should invest in based on the company that had the largest percentage growth in net income between 2022-2023.
