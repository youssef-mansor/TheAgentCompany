You have an idea that you want to pitch to your manager. Specifically, you want to integrate sotopia capabilities into openhands, and additionally support social tasks in openhands. You want to make a slide deck to formally present your idea, including multiple pages:

1st page: titled with "Idea: Integrate Sotopia into Openhands"
2nd page: a short introduction to Sotopia. Please refer to http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/sotopia for introduction to Sotopia.
3rd page: titled with "Social Tasks" and include a list of tasks you want to test openhands agent on.
4th page: a page titled with "Q&A" to seek feedback from your manager

Feel free to add additional pages or visual presentations to make the pitch more compelling.
Save the slide deck to '/workspace/pitch.pptx'
