For the sotopia project in gitlab (http://the-agent-company.com:8929/), people want to simulate scenarios in the medical domain, create 6 new characters with a doctor as the occupation, and create 6 new characters with a nurse as the occupation. (Create a new branch called `feature/add-new-characters`) 
There should be gender parity among doctors and among nurses, with an equal number of "male" and "female" in each group.
Put them in a single `medical_characters.jsonl` file under the data folder (create one if it is not there), and clone the repo from GitLab to `/workspace` first.
