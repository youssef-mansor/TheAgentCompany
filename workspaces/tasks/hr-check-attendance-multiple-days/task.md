Navigate to Nextcloud at https://ogma.lti.cs.cmu.edu/apps/dashboard.

* Use the provided april-attendance-data.csv spreadsheet in Nextcloud's "Documents/Human Resources Team/Attendance" folder to calculate the following: average work length in hours, the number of days of on-time departure, and the number of days of late arrival for each employee. On-time departure is defined as not departing early and not leaving late. Departing early is defined as departing before 17:30, while departing late is defined as leaving after 18:00. Late arrival is defined as arriving later than 9:00.

* Create a report called "april-attendance.xlsx" in the local /workspace directory. You must make sure that it is a xlsx file.

* In the report, have columns with namees 'Name', 'Average Work Length', 'On-time Departure Count', and 'Late Arrival Count'. Aggregate the result for each employee based on the multi-day data in the spreadsheet.
