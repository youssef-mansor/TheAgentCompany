A new sprint just started in the JanusGraph project and you have to assign Li Ming to a new issue in Plane. Using RocketChat, ask Li Ming to provide you with the issue he wants to work on and the sprint to put it in. Once you have the issue, create the issue in Plane, put it in the sprint, and assign it to Li Ming.
