The company needs to clean the spreadsheet and answer questions based on a client's request, which are specified as follows:
First, find the "Other Corp Area Totals.xlsx" spreadsheet under `Documents/Data-Analysis` at Cloud Drive. There are some missing values in the "data" sheet, fix those values by putting in "0"s.
Then, check the list of questions below the table, put in the answers in the corresponding answer cell. You can use Excel formula if it makes the calculation process easier. 

Correct the Excel, write down your answer to the question and save to `/workspace/corrected_other_corp_area_totals.xlsx`
