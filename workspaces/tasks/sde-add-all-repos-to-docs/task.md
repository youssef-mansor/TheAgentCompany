Right now we have a bunch of gitlab repositories, but we haven't updated our Documentation repo (http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/doc) to reflect all these contributions. Before we publicize our company's gitlab homepage, we want to fill in this documenation page with introductions for each repo we have. You need to edit the README.md file in Documentation, and put in information for all other repositories. For each repo, include their name with a link to the repo, and write the repo's tagline. You could find the tagline for each repo in the company's nextcloud (https://ogma.lti.cs.cmu.edu/apps/dashboard/). Unfortunately, the taglines were made at different times and are randomly scattered in the nextcloud, so you'll have to search for them.

On the bottom of the README, put in a contact section with Mike Chen's email (mike.chen@agentcompany.com).
