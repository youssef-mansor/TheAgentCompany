Find the `respondent_counts.xlsx` file at https://ogma.lti.cs.cmu.edu/apps/files/files/1555?dir=/Documents/Data%20Analysis&openfile=true, and based on the source "unformatted" sheet, create a "formatted" sheet and make formatting edits based on the following requirements:
1. Change the background color of top-header cells to skyblue (#87CEEB)
2. Make sure all cell values are horizontally centered in their cells

Do not change the "unformatted" sheet, only make changes in the "formatted" sheet.
