Navigate to http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/bustub/-/issues/759. There is instruction about a project called HyperLogLog algorithm. 

You need to copy the project instruction from gitlab to your company wiki page at http://the-agent-company.com:8929/root/doc/-/wikis, create a new wiki page with title HyperLogLog_project and let Gitlab auto-generate the wiki URL, and return the url of that wiki page. Write that as a .txt file called wiki_url.txt under the /workspace directory.
