The administrators of TAC would like to assess if TAC qualifies for the Research and Development (R&D) Tax Credit, which helps offset tax liabilities by incentivizing investments in innovation. To support this application, complete the following documentation:

- According to /Documents/Human Resources Team/Personnell_File.odt, reach out to relevant personell via RocketChat at http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home, asking about the time spent on R&D related activities and the nature of the work.
- Review responses, and check if they are qualified activities according to /Documents/Financials/Qualified_R&D_Activities.md.
- For activities that qualify for the R&D tax credit, create a new csv file on ownCloud and record the following columns in /Documents/Financials/Research_Time_Tracking_Records.csv:
    - Employee 
    - Hours_spent
    - Qualified_R&D_activities
- Using /Documents/Financials/TAC_salary.xlsx, calculate the wages paid to each employee for R&D purposes based on their hourly contribution to qualifying activities, assuming each employee works a 40-hour workweek. Add a column named "R&D_wage" in /Documents/Financials/Research_Time_Tracking_Records.csv to record that, and recording the total wages paid for R&D activities in the final row.
