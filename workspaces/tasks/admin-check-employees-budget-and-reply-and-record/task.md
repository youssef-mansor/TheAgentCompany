1. Collect equipment requests (name and quantity) from:
   - Li Ming (Database)
   - Zhang Wei (Database)
   - Huang Jie (Product)
   - Sophia Rodriguez (Product)
   at http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home

2. Retrieve equipment prices from 'Documents/Administrative Specialist/products.pdf' on owncloud(http://the-agent-company.com:8092)

3. Tell them the total cost of the equipment they requested.

4. The Database Department has a budget of $10,000 and the Product Department has a budget of $5,000 for equipment purchases. Calculate whether each department's budget is sufficient. If the budget is NOT sufficient, contact everyone in the department and ask them to reduce their expense.

5. Record equipment changes (if any) in '/workspace/result.txt' using format 'Name removed Equipment' (e.g., 'Chen Xinyi removed Printer'). No recording needed if no changes.
