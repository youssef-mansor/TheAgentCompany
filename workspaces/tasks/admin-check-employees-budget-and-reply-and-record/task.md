1. Collect equipment requests (name and quantity) from:
   - Li Ming (Database)
   - Zhang Wei (Database)
   - Huang Jie (Product)
   - Sophia Rodriguez (Product)
   at http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home

2. Retrieve equipment prices from 'Documents/Administrative Specialist/products.pdf' on NextCloud(https://ogma.lti.cs.cmu.edu/apps/files/files)

3. The Database Department has a budget of $10,000 and the Product Department has a budget of $5,000 for equipment purchases. Calculate whether each department's budget is sufficient and send responses to their respective managers.

4. Record equipment changes in '/workspace/result.txt' using format 'Name removed Equipment' (e.g., 'John removed Printer'). No recording needed if no changes.
