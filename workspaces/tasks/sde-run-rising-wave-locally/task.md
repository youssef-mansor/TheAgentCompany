Navigate to owncloud: http://the-agent-company.com:8092 and find Quick_start_RisingWave.pdf.

Install and start Rising Wave locally by following the command in the wiki page above. Assume psql is already installed.
Install risingwave under the /workspace directory. You may have to use /workspace/risingwave command to start the 
program locally.

Run Rising Wave, create table and insert some data. You must follow the example table
and data in the wiki Step 3: Insert some data and Step 4: Analyze and query data. Follow all of the steps until the very end
so the average_exam_scores table is available and has the same data as the example has. You can ignore possible issue with
numerical precision as long as they are identical to the second decimal.

Close the connection after inserting the data.
