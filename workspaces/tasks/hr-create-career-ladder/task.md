Navigate to owncloud at http://the-agent-company.com:8092. Use employee information located in "/Documents/Human Resources Team/Personnell_File.odt" to create a career ladder for TheAgentCompany. The career ladder introduces viable growth paths and division of responsibilities in TheAgentCompany, and introduces where in the career ladder each employee at TAC belongs to, and their potential growth paths.
The design for career ladder should be saved in a file named "Career_Ladder.odt" under "/Documents/Human Resources Team". Navigate to RocketChat at http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home. Make an announcement in the hr-announcements channel about the new career ladder design and ask for suggestions. This career ladder is a draft with room for creativity. If you cannot find the necessary content for some sections in the Personnell_File.odt document, please feel free to suggest them in the manual.
