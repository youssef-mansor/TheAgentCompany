# Checkpoints

This task has 9 points in total. It is composed of two parts:
1. Download the repository and set up the server properly
2. Add a new endpoint (POST) that is the same as the create_pair endpoint, but with mock LLM calls.
Check if this even runs.
3. Ensure that the endpoint actually runs successfully with the correct outputs

## Checkpoint 1 (2pt)

## Checkpoint 2 (3pt)

## Checkpoint 3 (4pts)
