Check all the spreadsheet under the "Data Analysis" folder at https://ogma.lti.cs.cmu.edu/apps/files/files?dir=/Documents
Write a python program to calculate the average number of rows and columns for all the spreadsheet files. If a file has multiple sheets, count all the tables in all sheets. Save your python script to "/workspace/data_stats.py" as reference for the calculation process.

Then, inform Jessica Lee that you have finished the analysis. Send her the statistics in the format:
Average Rows: Average Number of Rows rounded of 2 decimal places
Average Columns: Average Number of Columns rounded of 2 decimal places

Also, send her a message on http://the-agent-company.com:3000/ saying "Analysis Finished. Script can be found at script_path" Replace script_path with the path of the data anlysis script.
