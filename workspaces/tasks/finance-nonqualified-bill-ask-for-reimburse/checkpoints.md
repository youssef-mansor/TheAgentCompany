## Checkpoint 1 (2 point)

Confirmed writing in the file that (1) the bill is not qualified for reimbursement, and (2) the reasons for unable to reimburse the bill is because it is a credit card statement, which is not supported for reimbursements.
Note that the bill is not a real statement, but a AI-generated fake one. So from the automation perspective, this bill is not qualified for reimbursement too.
