# Checkpoints

## Checkpoint 1 (1 point)

Confirmed visited the reimbursement policy file on nextcloud

## Checkpoint 2 (1 point)

Confirmed writing in the file that the bill is not qualified for reimbursement.

## Checkpoint 3 (1 point)

Confirmed writing in the file about the reasons for unable to reimburse the bill, because it is a credit card statement, which is not supported for reimbursements.
Note that the bill is not a real statement, but a AI-generated fake one. So from the automation perspective, this bill is not qualified for reimbursement too.
