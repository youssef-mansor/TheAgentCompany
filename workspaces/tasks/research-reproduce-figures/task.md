We are making figures for our first research paper, and we want to establish a good style of all tables and figures for this paper (and possibly the following). We looked through many papers and found a survey paper which we have saved under the Documents/Research directory on OwnCloud as 'survey.pdf'. This paper has a style that we'd like to adopt in our paper.
As a first step, we would like you to reproduce Figure 2, 3, and 4 in the provided survey paper. For each figure that you reproduced, save it to '/workspace/figure{id}.pdf' and assign {id} to 2, 3, 4, respectively. Note that you should only reproduce the figure and not the caption. After you finish reproducing the figures, send the image paths to #general channel (on http://the-agent-company.com:3000/) and asks for the feedback of other group members.

Second, we would like you to reproduce Table 1, 2, 3 by writing latex code. For each table you reproduced, save it to '/workspace/table{id}.tex' and assign {id} to 1, 2, 3, respectively. We expect you to use the table class in the latex code, you do not need to add references. You should also compile them and save the pdfs as '/workspace/table{id}.pdf'. Note that we would like you to reproduce captions for the tables.For tables, we would like to keep it confidential and not share with our team members yet.
