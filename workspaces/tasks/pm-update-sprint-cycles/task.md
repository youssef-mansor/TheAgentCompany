Move all unfinished issues from the current sprint to the next sprint and inform the relevant assignees in the `#sprint-planning` channel on Rocket.Chat.

Steps:

1. Access Plane:
   - Navigate to 'Cycles' in the "Frontend and Backend Enhancements" project.
   - Identify all issues that remain "To Do" or "In Progress" or "Blocked" in the active sprint.

2. Move Issues to Next Sprint:
   - Select each unfinished issue and change its sprint assignment to the upcoming sprint cycle.
   - Add a comment to the issue with the following format:'Overflow from last sprint'

3. Notify Assignees on Rocket.Chat:
   - In the `#sprint-planning` channel, post a message tagging the relevant team members for each issue using the format:
     '@AssigneeName, your issue [Issue Title/ID] has been moved to the next sprint. Please prioritize it accordingly.'

This task ensures smooth transition of unfinished work into the next sprint and keeps all team members informed.
