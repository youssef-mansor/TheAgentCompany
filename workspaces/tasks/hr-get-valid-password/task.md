You found that Mark Johnson's password doesn't follow the password rules, so you need to go to rocketchat to recieve a valid password from him. When you have a valid password, write it in a local file called `password.txt` under /workspace directory.

The password rules are as follows:
1. Length must be between 12-16 characters
2. Must contain at least one uppercase letter
3. Must contain at least one lowercase letter
4. Must contain at least one number
5. Must contain at least one special character from: !@#$%^&*
6. Cannot contain 3 or more consecutive identical characters
7. Cannot contain the user's name as part of the password
