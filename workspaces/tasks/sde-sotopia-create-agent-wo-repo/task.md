For the sotopia project in gitlab (http://the-agent-company.com:8929/), create a new branch called `feature/actionAgent` and a new agent (called `ActionAgent`) in the Sotopia repo that can only issue action commands. 
You can check the `LLMAgent` in `sotopia/agents/llm_agent.py` for the inspiration.
Push the change to the gitlab and make a pull request
