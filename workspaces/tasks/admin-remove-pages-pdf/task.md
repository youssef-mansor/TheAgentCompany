Our company is organizing a paper reading session, and the chosen paper is about "OpenHands". Could you assist by creating a shortened version of the paper?

Please Include the "References" section in the shortened version, but remove all content after it. Save the shortened paper locally as /workspace/openhands_short.pdf on your system (not on owncloud).
The original paper on can be found on owncloud (http://the-agent-company.com:8092) in the Documents/Research directory.

Thank you! Someone else will print the paper before the meeting.
