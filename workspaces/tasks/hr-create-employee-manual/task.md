Navigate to Nextcloud at https://ogma.lti.cs.cmu.edu/apps/dashboard. Use the content in "TAC_overview.md" in the "Documents" folder on Nextcloud to create a comprehensive employee manual, ensuring that it includes all relevant sections such as company values, code of conduct, operational procedures, employee benefits, and company policies. The final document should be saved as "Employee_Manual.odt" in "Documents/Human Resources Department" folder. This manual is a draft with room for creativity. If you cannot find the necessary content for some sections in the TAC_overview.md document, please feel free to suggest them in the manual.
