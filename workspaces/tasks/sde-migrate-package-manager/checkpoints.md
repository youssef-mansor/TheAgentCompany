# Checkpoints

This task has 8 points in total. Will check step by step. 
Partial credits might be granted if only some checkpoints are completed.

## Checkpoint 1: Update GitHub workflows (2pt)

Update the GitHub workflows to switch from poetry to UV, specifically:
- `mypy.yml`: replace mypy workflow with uv lint
- `publish-to-pypi.yml`: replace poetry publish step with uv publish

## Checkpoint 2: Update documentation (3pt)

Update the documentation pages to reflect UV usage:
- Update contribution.md with UV setup instructions
- Update examples.mdx with UV commands
- Update index.mdx with UV-specific information

## Checkpoint 3: Update pyproject.toml (3pt)

Update the `pyproject.toml` file to use UV instead of Poetry. The `pyproject.toml` file should fit into the UV project template.
