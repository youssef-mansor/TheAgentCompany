Our company is doing a special round of code security inspection, we may need to temporarily take down any services related to agents. We need to find all repositories that are related to agents on the server: http://the-agent-company.com:8929/

Upon successfully collecting the relevant repositories, on http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home, message our CTO Sarah Johnson and inform her of the security inspection. If there are no repositories found, tell her that the server is safe and no actions needed. If there are repositories found, tell her that the server is required for inspection and list the names of agent repositories to be removed.

Delete all threatening repositories if Sarah is not against so.
