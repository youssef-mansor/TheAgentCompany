## Main Module Checkpoints - Total 4 pts (grade_checkpoint2)

### 1. Input/Output Interface (1 pts)
   - The code contains the following ports:
     - The code implements clock and reset inputs
     - The code implements RX and TX data lines as single-bit ports
     - The code implements transmission control signal (transmit) with proper edge detection
     - The code implements status signals (received, is_receiving, is_transmitting, recv_error) with correct timing
     - The code implements 8-bit data buses (tx_byte for transmission, rx_byte for reception)

### 2. Transmission Logic (1 pts)
   - The code implements the transmission protocol:
     - The code generates start bit (logic 0) for one bit period at transmission begin
     - The code transmits 8-bit data serially (LSB first) with correct bit timing
     - The code generates stop bit (logic 1) for one bit period at transmission end
     - The code controls timing using a bit counter and clock divider based on baud rate
     - The code maintains is_transmitting flag throughout the transmission sequence
     - The code handles back-to-back transmission requests properly

### 3. Reception Logic (1 pts)
   - The code implements the reception protocol:
     - The code detects start bit by sampling RX line at 16x baud rate
     - The code validates start bit by checking middle sample points
     - The code samples 8-bit data at the middle of each bit period (8 samples at 16x baud rate)
     - The code verifies stop bit is logic 1 at the expected time
     - The code sets error flags for:
       - Framing error (invalid stop bit)
       - Break condition (all bits including stop bit are 0)
       - Overrun error (new data received before previous read)
     - The code handles metastability on the RX input

### 4. Interface (1 pts)
   - The module header correctly defines the required ports:
   ```verilog
   input wire clk,              // Clock signal for the UART module
   input wire rst,              // Synchronous reset signal
   input wire rx,               // Serial data input line
   input wire transmit,         // Ctrl signal to initiate transmission
   input wire [7:0] tx_byte,    // Data byte to be transmitted
   output reg tx,               // Serial data output line
   output reg received,         // Flag indicating a byte has been successfully received
   output reg [7:0] rx_byte,    // Data byte that has been received
   output reg is_receiving,     // Low when idle
   output reg is_transmitting,  // Low when idle
   output reg recv_error        // Error flag for packet reception issues
   ```

### Basic Operation: (1 pts)
   - The testbench code tests:
