Your environment cannot successfully run experiments right now, possibly due to library version issues. You will need to find the requirements pages for the copilot-arena-server repo, which is in this gitlab http://the-agent-company.com:8929/, and modify 'myenv.txt' according to the requirement instructions. Ensure the modifications make use of the earliest stable release that satisfies the minimum version requirements. Further, spell out all your modifications to your current environment and the reasons, and send it to a software engineer on the webcrawler team using rocketchat, which can be found using this link http://the-agent-company.com:3000/, who is awaiting your results.
