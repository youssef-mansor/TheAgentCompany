There is an all hands meeting. You need to collect the feedback of everyone who attended. 
You should first ask Huang Jie for names of all the participants, using http://the-agent-company.com:3000/.
Then, ask each of the participant for feedback and score (1-5) about the meeting, using http://the-agent-company.com:3000/.
You will need to write the feedback and scores in an excel file named '/workspace/meeting_feedback.xlsx'. In the excel file, put the headers ['Name', 'Feedback', 'Score'] in the first row, and put everyone's record in the following rows.
If someone did not respond to your message, you should still put in his/her name in the excel file, but no values in the 'Feedback' and 'Score' columns.
