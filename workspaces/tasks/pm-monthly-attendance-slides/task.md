The attendance of our group has not been so great recently. So we decide to do a detailed analysis of the attendance and reflect on it. You need to help our HR manager Chen Xinyi analyze the number of dates recorded in the attendance sheet (it is on the website https://ogma.lti.cs.cmu.edu, navigate to "Documents/Human Resources Team/Attendance") for everyone. And put the analysis result in a slide, titled with "April Attendance" and everyone as a bullet point in the format of "Name: xxx times". Save the slide as "/workspace/April Attendance.pptx" and tell Chen Xinyi the path you saved it. You can find Chen Xinyi on RocketChat (http://the-agent-company.com:3000/)
