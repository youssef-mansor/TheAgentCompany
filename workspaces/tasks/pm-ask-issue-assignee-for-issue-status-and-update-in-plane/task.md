As a project manager, you need to check the status of the "Evaluate data throughput" issue in the RisingWave project. Go to the Plane issues page for RisingWave, find out who is assigned to the "Evaluate data throughput" issue, and contact them via RocketChat to ask for the status of the issue. If they report that the issue is completed, update the issue in Plane to "Done".

The Plane issues page can be accessed at: http://the-agent-company.com:8091/tac/projects/ea796314-eeec-41aa-816d-58be13909bf2/issues/
