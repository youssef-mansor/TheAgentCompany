You are a quality engineer. Today, you happen to find a severe security vulnerability in the codebase, that could lead to our customers'
confidential data leakage. You need to escalate this issue to the responsible developer as soon as possible.

Goto http://the-agent-company.com:3000/, find Zhang Wei, and tell them about this emergency. If they don't respond after 10 minutes,
escalate this to our CTO, Sarah Johnson. Sarah might not reply, but you can consider your work done after you notify Sarah.
