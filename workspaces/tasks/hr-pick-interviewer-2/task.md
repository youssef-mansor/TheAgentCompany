You are going to pick an interviewer for a candidate. You should ask hiring resource manager Chen Xinyi in Rocketchat (http://the-agent-company.com:3000) about who is available to interview. 
Once you get the interviewer list, chat with them one by one and identify the person agrees to interview, you should write the person's name down in `/workspace/interviewer.txt` file locally.
