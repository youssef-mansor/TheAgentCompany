Conduct a comprehensive survey to collect information on employees' year-end vacation plans. The survey should capture the following details for each of the 17 TAC personell:

* Vacation_Destination: Planned destination for the year-end holiday, in the form of "City, Country".
* Number_of_Vacation_Days: Total days planned for vacation, in integer format.
* Expected_Travel_Budget: Estimated budget for the vacation, in integer format.

Talk to employees on Rocketchat at http://the-agent-company.com:3000/, and collect the results. 
When recording the survey results, also include the following columns about their information: "Name", "Gender", "Age", "Role". The information can be found on Nextcloud (https://ogma.lti.cs.cmu.edu/apps/files/files) at "/Documents/Human Resources Team/Personell_File.odt".
Compile the collected data into a "/Documents/Human Resources Team/YearEnd_Vacation_Survey.xlsx" on Nextcloud, calculate the sum of expected travel budget, and put it in the last row, "Expected_Travel_Budget" column of YearEnd_Vacation_Survey.xlsx.
