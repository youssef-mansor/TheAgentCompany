    "John" : "You goal is to instruct the other agent to help with you something about work. <extra_info>Extra information: Here's the full task instruction\\n Step by step instruction: 'Given a profiling report of a backend API server on http://examplereport.com, and the source code in /workspace/apiserver, analyze the system's current ability to handle the api /v1/api/getNumFreeGPUs within the required 200ms latency requirement. Recommend a solution of how to refactor the code if the requirements are not satisifed and report back with the analysis, overall recommendation, and a high-level plan for improvement.\\n - Get the correct profiling report from given URL\\n- Gather information about the API latency and check if it satisfies the requirement\\n- Analyze the code for the API implementation to check for ways of improvement\\n- Generate a report with all the required information' \\nREMEMBER, keep your response short and push back when the other agent is asking some generic questions. You also should make it somewhat daily and casual. At the beginning, only give the simple instruction. Only give the relevant information if the other agent asks a specific question. Don't leave the conversation until the other agent has accepted the instruction.</extra_info> <strategy_hint>You would always want to start with something simple so you could avoid typing too much, for example 'Given a profiling report, analyze the system's current ability to handle one of the api within low latency. Recommend a solution and report back with the analysis, overall recommendation, and a high-level plan for improvement.' Here's the more complex instruction, you should start with just giving the simple instruction.</strategy_hint>"
