We are planning a new project to build out a web app for JanusGraph. It will need:

0.5 months of Li Ming's effort
0.5 months of project management
0.5 months of design
1 month of frontend
1.5 months of backend
0.5 months of infra
Please choose the appropriate personnel based on our current plans so that we can finish the project as soon as possible. You can assume that it is January 1st 2025. To do so, create a csv file called project-plan.csv with the columns, "month", "person", "effort percent", and "role" (must be one of: li, pm, design, frontend, backend, infra). Save it in the /workspace folder.

Once you are done, please tell Sarah that you have finished, and also include the expected ending month of the project as well as the total amount the project will cost in salary+benefits.

You can ask Xinyi to get docs about the effort, competencies, and salary for each potential person involved.

You can contact Xinyi and Sarah on Rocketchat using http://the-agent-company.com:3000/
