# Development Guide

Target audience: benchmark developers. You want to create/modify tasks, and/or modify data pre-baked into the servers.

If you wish to contribute your changes, check out the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) on how to clone and set up the project initially before moving on. Otherwise, you can clone TheAgentCompany project directly.


## Contribute to server data

All services (GitLab, ownCloud, Rocket.Chat, Plane) are pre-baked with data. If you do not need to modify the data, you can skip this section. We generally don't accept contributions to change of data since most of them is in binary format. You could, however, modify the data and host your own server with the modified data for your own use.

**GitLab:** Please refer to [this](../servers/gitlab/README.md) for more details.

**OwnCloud** TODO

**Rocket.Chat:** After the service starts, run `backup-rocketchat` to back up the service, and run `restore-rocketchat` to restore the service.

**Plane:** TODO

## Contribute to a task

If you want to create a task or modify an existing task, please read [this](../workspaces/tasks/example/README.md). We welcome
contributions to tasks, including new tasks and bug fixes to existing tasks.
