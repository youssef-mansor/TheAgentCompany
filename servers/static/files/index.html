    Welcome to Bridges-2
We take security very seriously. Please take a minute now to read PSC policies on passwords, security guidelines, resource use, and privacy. You are expected to comply with these policies at all times when using PSC systems. If you have questions at any time, you can send email to help@psc.edu.

Are you new to HPC?
If you are new to high performance computing, please read Getting Started with HPC before you begin your research on Bridges-2. It explains HPC concepts which may be unfamiliar. You can also check the Introduction to Unix or the Glossary for quick definitions of terms that may be new to you.

We hope that that information along with the Bridges-2 User Guide will have you diving into your work on Bridges-2. But if you have any questions, don’t hesitate to email us for help at help@psc.edu.

Questions?
PSC support is here to help you get your research started and keep it on track. If you have questions at any time, you can send email to help@psc.edu.

Set your PSC password
Before you can connect to Bridges-2, you must have a PSC password.

If you have an active account on any other PSC system
PSC usernames and passwords are the same across all PSC systems. You will use the same username and password on Bridges-2 as for your other PSC account.

If you do not have an active account on any other PSC system:
You must create a PSC password. Go to the web-based PSC password change utility  at  apr.psc.edu  to set your PSC password.

PSC password policies
Computer security depends heavily on maintaining secrecy of passwords.

PSC uses Kerberos authentication on all its production systems, and your PSC password (also known as your Kerberos password) is the same on all PSC machines.

Set your initial PSC password
When you receive a PSC account, go to the web-based PSC password change utility to set your password.  For security, you should use a unique password for your PSC account, not one that you use for other sites.

Change your PSC password
Changing your password changes it on all PSC systems. To change your Kerberos password, use the web-based PSC password change utility .

PSC password requirements
Your password must:

be at least eight characters long
contain characters from at least three of the following groups:
lower-case letters
upper-case letters
digits
special characters, excluding apostrophes (') and quotes (")
be different from the last three PSC passwords you have used
not be re-used on other accounts
remain private; it must not be shared with anyone
be changed at least once per year
Password safety
Under NO circumstances does PSC reveal any passwords over the telephone, FAX them to any location, send them through email, set them to a requested string, or perform any other action that could reveal a password.

If someone claiming to represent PSC contacts you and requests information that in any manner would reveal a password, be assured that the request is invalid and do NOT comply.

It is strongly recommended to use a Password Manager to aid in generating secure passwords and managing accounts.
