## Server: gitlab


### Starting up server

Navigate to parent directory (servers), and run the below commands:

```bash
# start gitlab
make start-gitlab
```

Then you can navigate to http://$HOSTNAME:8929 to visit GitLab on your browser.

Root user name: `root`
Root user password: `theagentcompany`

### Import data

#### Benchmark user

Data is prepared and imported as part of Dockerfile. As a benchmark user, you
don't need to worry about data population. Everything is set up automatically.

Before every task that involves GitLab, we need to restore GitLab to its initial
state (i.e. the state with prepopulated data). This is handled by `init.sh`, so
benchmark users don't need to worry about it.

TODO: set up GitHub CI to publish built image to ghcr.io

#### Benchmark developer

If you are a benchmark developer and would like to add a new repo, please follow
the below steps:

1. Launch a GitLab server. It can be any GitLab instance at any place. The preferred
version is 17.5.1-ce.0 for best compatibility with the version used in our server image.
2. Import repos from outside, e.g. GitHub. Alternatively,
you could also create a new repo on your own. Note, this involves a lot of Internet
traffic and might be slow.
3. [Export](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/import_export.html#export-a-project-and-its-data) repo from GitLab. A tar file would be generated and you could download to your local machine. Note, this might
be slow.
4. Put the downloaded tar file under `servers/gitlab/exports` folder. Note that all tar files are
ignored by git.
5. Then run `make rebuild-gitlab` under `servers` folder to rebuild GitLab image.

As you can see, the steps 1-3 essentially do a data conversion, transforming data
from an external source (GitHub) to GitLab proprietary format. You could leverage
`github2gitlab.py` to automate steps 1 & 2. Unfortunately, GitLab does not provide
API to export to local disks, so you have to do step 3 manually.
