Main Module Points
************************************Evaluation Report*******************************************
## checkpoints and scores

### 1. pipeline latency (1 pts)
   - the product is correctly calculated after three clock cycles: **1**

### 2. reset priority (1 pts)
   - if `reset` is active, the pipeline clears (outputs are invalid) regardless of inputs: **1**

### 3. valid signal (1 pts)
   - the valid signal is asserted only when the pipeline result is ready: **1**

### 4. interface (1 pts)
   - the module header correctly defines the required ports: **1**

**final score: 4/4**

Testbench comprehensiveness points
************************************Evaluation Report*******************************************
```
### initial reset: (1 pts)
   - not met: the file does not seem to check whether the pipeline produces invalid output after reset.

### correctness: (1 pts)
   - met: the file tests all 256 cases of 4-bit inputs a and b to verify correct products. (score: 1)

### pipeline behavior: (1 pts)
   - met: the product is checked after a 15-time unit delay, conforming to a 3 clock cycle wait, which matches the expected delay given the clock period. (score: 1)

### reset during operation: (1 pts)
   - not met: there is no evidence in the file that reset is asserted during active operation to verify that the pipeline clears.

### randomized test: (1 pts)
   - not met: there is no indication of randomized inputs and clock behavior to ensure full pipeline functionality under varying conditions.

### edge cases: (1 pts)
   - not met: specific edge cases such as a = 0, b = 0, a = 15, and b = 15 are not explicitly tested.

### clock stability: (1 pts)
   - not met: the file does not confirm that the multiplier produces output only on rising clock edges.

**final score: 2/7**
