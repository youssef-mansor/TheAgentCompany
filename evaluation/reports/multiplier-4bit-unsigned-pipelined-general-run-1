Main Module Points
************************************Evaluation Report*******************************************
## main module checkpoints - total 4 pts (grade_checkpoint2)

### 1. pipeline latency (1 pts)
   - the product is computed in three stages (partial_product1, partial_product2, partial_product3).
   **score: 1/1**

### 2. reset priority (1 pts)
   - the reset signal clears registers and invalidates the output regardless of inputs when active.
   **score: 1/1**

### 3. valid signal (1 pts)
   - the valid signal is always asserted when a product is produced, without a condition for readiness.
   **score: 0/1**

### 4. interface (1 pts)
   - the module header correctly defines the required ports matching the specification.
   **score: 1/1**

**final score: 3/4**

Testbench comprehensiveness points
************************************Evaluation Report*******************************************
## testbench comprehensiveness checkpoints - total 7 pts (grade_checkpoint3)

### initial reset: (1 pts)
   - the testbench asserts a reset at the beginning (`reset = 1`), but does not explicitly check `valid = 0` immediately after reset.
   - score: 0 pts

### correctness: (1 pts)
   - the testbench iterates through all possible input combinations of `a` and `b` (4-bit Ã— 4-bit = 256 cases) and verifies correct products with a comparison.
   - score: 1 pt

### pipeline behavior: (1 pts)
   - the testbench waits for 15 time units, which corresponds to 3 clock cycles after changing inputs, but does not directly check the assertion of `valid`.
   - score: 0 pts

### reset during operation: (1 pts)
   - there is no explicit test case for asserting reset during active operation in the provided testbench.
   - score: 0 pts

### randomized test: (1 pts)
   - the testbench does not include randomized input or clock behaviors.
   - score: 0 pts

### edge cases: (1 pts)
   - the testbench inherently tests edge cases as it covers all combinations from `a = 0, b = 0` to `a = 15, b = 15`.
   - score: 1 pt

### clock stability: (1 pts)
   - the file does not explicitly check whether output is produced only on rising clock edges.
   - score: 0 pts

**final score: 2/7**
