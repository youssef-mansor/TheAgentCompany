errors/ issues

The simulation still indicates failures in both the transmission and reception tests. Let's further investigate and refine the UART module to address these issues. I'll make additional adjustments to the code.

the agent kept editing /openhands/workspace/uart.v and wasa stuck at this issue till it probably terminated in step 100
