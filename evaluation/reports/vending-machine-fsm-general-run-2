Main Module Points
************************************Evaluation Report*******************************************
### 1. input interface (1 pts)
   - checkpoint not met: the module implements clock and reset signals but fails to handle multiple denominations of coin inputs accurately (expected 3 bits for different denominations but only 2 bits are used).

   **score: 0**

### 2. output interface (1 pts)
   - checkpoint met: the module has all required output ports implemented including change return amount, product dispensed signal, error condition signal, and current balance.

   **score: 1**

### 3. fsm states (1 pts)
   - checkpoint not met: the fsm does not include all required states. specifically, it lacks the 'product selection' state needed for validating selection as described.

   **score: 0**

### 4. interface (1 pts)
   - checkpoint not met: the module header correctly defines the majority of the ports, but 'coin_in' is inaccurately declared as a 2-bit input instead of the required 3-bit.

   **score: 0**

**final score: 1/4**

This message repeated 5 times : Thought: It seems there is a persistent issue with removing the extra parenthesis. Let's try a different approach by directly editing the file to remove the unnecessary line.
